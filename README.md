MELICA investigates the empirical basis of Cold-War preparedness in Aarhus by (1) reconstructing the everyday experience of individuals living in Cold-War Aarhus through spatial analysis of shelter locations and text analysis of written sources to assess whether the evidence points towards a militarization of everyday life or ‘normalization’ of war, (2) identifying gaps between how Cold-War civil defense was conceptualized at the national level and delivered at the local level in Aarhus, and (3) evaluating civil defense effectiveness by simulating a shelter drill, identifying weak points and stakeholders in civil defense planning.

The roadmap to accomplish our goals combines three research activities:
* Documentation of surviving civilian shelters in the Aarhus kommune, on the basis of field survey and archival data
* Creation of a thematic digital archive focused on the civil defense from materials present in the Aarhus City Archive
* Smart text and spatial analysis of the two archives :smile:
